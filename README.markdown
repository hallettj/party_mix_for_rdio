Party Mix for Rdio
====================

UserScript for Rdio that adds a button to your Collection view that adds 25
random songs from your collection to your play queue.

I enjoy Rdio; but I thought that it was really missing a "shuffle all" feature.
So I put this script together.


Installing
------------

Party Mix works with Firefox and Google Chrome.  If you are using Firefox you
will need to install the [Greasemonkey][] extension before proceeding.

[Greasemonkey]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/  "Greasemonkey"

[Click here to install the script.][install]

Usage
------

Open or reload Rdio and navigate to your collection.  You should see a button
above the list of artists in your collection that says "Add 25 random songs to
Queue".
